# Hacking CHEMION LED Glasses

This project aims to document the [CHEMION Bluetooth LED Glasses](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CHEMION-Bluetooth-Messages-Animation-Drawings/dp/B01B41PHJM) from a hacker's perspective, mostly focusing on Bluetooth packets for interoperability purposes. All information here is as a result of experimentation and reverse engineering.
