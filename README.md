This project aims to document the [CHEMION Bluetooth LED Glasses](https://www.amazon.co.uk/CHEMION-Bluetooth-Messages-Animation-Drawings/dp/B01B41PHJM) from a hacker's perspective with the goal to imulate both Server and Client functions of these devices. The resurch mostly focuses on the Bluetooth packets for interoperability purposes. All information here is as a result of experimentation and reverse engineering.

Visit [the project wiki](https://github.com/notpike/ChemionHacking/wiki) for information.

### TODO
* ~~Figure out checksum algorithm of UART Message~~
* Pull firmware from the glassess
* ~~Build POC Client application to send commands to the Chemion Glasses~~ \*Note: Working POC needs improvment.
* Build POC Server application to receve commands from the Chemion App
* Build Web App to interface with the Chemion Glassess via a M5Stack (ESP32)
